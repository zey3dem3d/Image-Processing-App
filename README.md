Image Processing App

The Image Processing App is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). This app allows users to load, process, and save images with various image processing techniques, such as blur, edge detection, resize, adding noise, and removing noise.

Features
- Load images in common formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- Apply blur effect using Gaussian blur filter.
- Detect edges in images using gradient-based algorithms.
- Resize images to custom dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Add noise to images to simulate real-world conditions.
- Remove noise from images using smoothing filters.
- Save processed images in PNG format.

Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Pillow for image processing).
3. Run the main.py file to launch the application.
4. Load an image using the "Load Image" button.
5. Use the various processing buttons to apply effects to the image.
6. Click the "Save Image" button to save the processed image.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (pip install Pillow)
- Tkinter library (pip install tk)
